Required installations and steps to run the program

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)cx_Oracle using pip commands 
2)Download the instantclient so that the cx_Oracle can refer the function calls from here.
3)Make sure you set the environment variables for step two.
4)I have the spool file named as "my output.txt" which contains	all the required SQL queries that needs to be created for Item 1 in project ie. five table creations and also to show the insertions I have given select queries.
